This year, the ICIS consortium allowed only one student to be nominated from each university or institution. The application process was a thoughtful exercise, requiring the submission of a summary of my current dissertation in the form of a short paper, which details my research question, motivation, methodologies, and contribution to the Information Systems field.</p>\n<p>However, the eligibility criteria, application procedures, and selection process may vary from year to year and depend on the conference host (such as ICIS, ECIS, AMCIS, or PACIS).</p>\n<p>The heart of the selection process lies in the hands of the consortium co-chairs and faculty mentors. They meticulously reviewed each submission, considering the depth and potential impact of the research. Out of numerous submissions, only the top 40 students were selected to participate in the consortium, making it a truly prestigious and competitive opportunity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"My-Journey-Timeline\"><a href=\"#My-Journey-Timeline\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"My Journey Timeline\"></a>My Journey Timeline</h2><p>Let’s take a glimpse at the key milestones that shaped my path from program nomination to standing at the doors of the consortium.</p>\n<table class=\"table is-striped is-hoverable\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Date</th>\n    <th>Milestone</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td>May 9</td>\n    <td>Institutional Nomination Submission</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>May 18</td>\n    <td>Institutional Nomination Announcement</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>May 29</td>\n    <td>Consortium Nomination Submission</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>July 29</td>\n    <td>Nomination Acceptance Notification</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sep. 12 </td>\n    <td>Visa Application Submission</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Nov. 29</td>\n    <td>Visa Approval</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Dec. 2</td>\n    <td>Visa &amp; Passport Deliver</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Dec. 6</td>\n    <td>Consortium Start</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Dec. 8</td>\n    <td>Consortium End</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Dec. 9</td>\n    <td>Shuttle to ICIS</td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h1 id=\"Consortium-Composition\"><a href=\"#Consortium-Composition\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Consortium Composition\"></a>Consortium Composition</h1><p>A typical day in the consortium unfolds in three main parts: (a) presentations and discussions; (b) panels and&#x2F;or keynotes; and (c) networking. While I’ll focus on the first part here, I’ll cover panels and keynote content in the following sections. Networking? Well, you’ve got your own unique way of handling that better than I do!</p>\n<p>In the first part, we were divided into groups of seven or eight attendees and two or three faculty mentors. Each group member had an hour to present their dissertation research, receive feedback from faculty mentors and fellow group members, and engage in a collective discussion about questions, suggestions, and comments.</p>\n<p>Before the consortium, I received guidance to prepare slides for a concise ten-minute presentation of my research. The emphasis was on focusing the presentation on questions I grappled with, seeking feedback from mentors and group members. It was assumed that everyone had already reviewed my summary short paper and slides. Additionally, I was expected to familiarize myself with the work of others in my group, preparing constructive feedback to share after their presentations.</p>\n<p>The time allocation for presentation and discussion was strategically set at ten versus fifty minutes. This ratio favored discussion, proving to be constructive given the preparedness of all participants. The experience contrasted with typical conference presentations where a 20-minute presentation is followed by a brief five-minute discussion. </p>\n<p>An unexpected and enriching aspect was the exposure to unfamiliar research methodologies through reading my peers’ papers. Yet, I did encounter some challenges. The audience occasionally sought clarification during presentations to offer more insightful feedback. This taught me a crucial lesson – tailoring my presentation to the audience. Making my message intellectually accessible resulted in less confusion and higher engagement, leading to feedback of better quality.</p>\n<p>Another point of reflection was the wish for electronic feedback from each group member. Juggling notetaking and responding to real-time comments proved challenging. Implementing a system where each member could electronically note and deliver their feedback (e.g., a Word document) would ensure that nothing is missed, and the audience is accountable for carefully reviewing my summary paper.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Timetable-of-A-Typically-Consortium-Day\"><a href=\"#Timetable-of-A-Typically-Consortium-Day\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Timetable of A Typically Consortium Day\"></a>Timetable of A Typically Consortium Day</h2><table class=\"table is-striped is-hoverable\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Time</th>\n    <th>Activity</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>Breakfast</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>8:20 – 9:20</td>\n    <td>Panel/Keynote</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>9:30 – 10:30</td>\n    <td>Presentation &amp; Discussion</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>10:30 – 11:00</td>\n    <td>Coffee Break</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>11:00 – 12:00</td>\n    <td>Presentation &amp; Discussion</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>12:00 – 13:30</td>\n    <td>Lunch</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>13:30 – 14:30</td>\n    <td>Presentation &amp; Discussion</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>14:40 – 15:40</td>\n    <td>Presentation &amp; Discussion</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>15:40 – 16:10</td>\n    <td>Coffee Break</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>16:30 – 17:30</td>\n    <td>Presentation &amp; Discussion</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>18:30 – 20:30</td>\n    <td>Dinner</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>Free time</td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h1 id=\"Panel-1-Research-and-Teaching\"><a href=\"#Panel-1-Research-and-Teaching\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Panel 1: Research and Teaching\"></a>Panel 1: Research and Teaching</h1><div class=\"justified-gallery\" id=\"g2\">\n\n<p><img src=\"/2023/12/29/Embarking-on-Scholarly-Seas-A-Journey-through-ICIS-2023-Doctoral-Consortium/PXL_20231207_025240061~3.jpg\" alt=\"Panel 1 Research &amp; Teaching\"></p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"tabs my-3 is-fullwidth is-boxed\">\n        <ul class=\"mx-0 my-0\">\n            <li class=\"is-active\">\n          <a href=\"#panel1-description\">\n              <span class=\"icon is-small ml-0\">\n                <i class=\"fa-solid fa-quote-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\n            </span>Panel Description\n          </a>\n      </li><li>\n          <a href=\"#panel1-members\">\n              <span class=\"icon is-small ml-0\">\n                <i class=\"fa-solid fa-chalkboard-user\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\n            </span>Members\n          </a>\n      </li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"panel1-description\" class=\"tab-content\">\n          <article class=\"message is-info\">\n  <div class=\"message-body\">\n  The first panel delved into crucial aspects of research and teaching tailored for doctoral students reaching the summit of their academic journey.

Examples of past research projects and my perspectives on the opportunities that lie ahead will be used to add substance to the presentation.\n  </div>\n</article>\n\n<h2 id=\"Preparing-for-the-Journey\"><a href=\"#Preparing-for-the-Journey\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Preparing for the Journey\"></a>Preparing for the Journey</h2><ul>\n<li><strong>People:</strong> Collaborating with leaders in Operations Research, Information Systems, Marketing Economics, and AI.</li>\n<li><strong>Building Comparative Advantage:</strong><ul>\n<li>Cultivating intellectual curiosity in studying digital technology as a decision-making enabler.</li>\n<li>Developing deep methodological strength in statistics, optimization, and computing.</li>\n<li>Embracing problem-driven research, which opens avenues for interdisciplinary studies at the interface of IT, OR&#x2F;Data Science, Social Science, and Computer Science.</li>\n<li>Choosing problems that offer opportunities to impact the discipline and beyond while contributing to science.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Early Exposure:</strong> My journey as a Ph.D. student involved impactful projects, including a Franz Edelman Award-winning project on the use of IS and OR in production, distribution, and marketing with Citgo Petroleum.</li>\n<li><strong>Developing a Personal Brand:</strong><ul>\n<li>Establishing a reputation for a cumulative and coherent body of work.</li>\n<li>Striving for impact within and beyond the discipline.</li>\n<li>Investing in trusted relationships that not only benefit personal work but also the organization.</li>\n<li>Maintaining a spreadsheet of future letter writers and nurturing those connections regularly—they are your fan club.</li>\n<li>Giving back.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Pathways-to-Impact\"><a href=\"#Pathways-to-Impact\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Pathways to Impact\"></a>Pathways to Impact</h2><ul>\n<li><p><strong>Scholarly Impact:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Achieving publications in top journals and conferences.</li>\n<li>Delivering presentations at other universities and industry workshops.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>GitHub Repos:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making methods available through GitHub repositories, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Presenting to Policymakers and Business Leaders:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Actively engaging with organizations like INFORMS and the Computing Research Association, which increasingly provide opportunities for impactful interactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Volunteering-Public-Policy-and-Societal-Impact\"><a href=\"#Volunteering-Public-Policy-and-Societal-Impact\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Volunteering, Public Policy, and Societal Impact\"></a>Volunteering, Public Policy, and Societal Impact</h2></li>\n<li><p><strong>Giving Back</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contributing to the academic community as a reviewer, associate editor, senior editor, deputy editor, and editor-in-chief.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Public Policy and Society</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Starting points provided by AIS and INFORMS paved the way for impactful roles like being part of the National AI Advisory Committee to the President, Chair of the AI Futures Committee, and Chair of the DOD Responsible AI Academic Council.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Leadership</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Involving with INFORMS ISS and volunteering as the President showcased the leadership opportunities within our academic community.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Policy-Informed Research and Public Dissemination</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Highlighting the intersection of policy and research, Insights were shared into the trillion-dollar questions of generative AI.

The ideal time to participate is when you have an initial draft of your dissertation, but you are still open to suggestions and improvements. This way, you can benefit from the constructive criticism and guidance that the consortium provides. However, you can also apply earlier or later in your PhD journey, depending on your goals and needs.</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"tabs my-3 is-fullwidth is-boxed\">\n        <ul class=\"mx-0 my-0\">\n            <li class=\"is-active\">\n          <a href=\"#q2\">\n              <span class=\"icon is-small ml-0\">\n                <i class=\"fa-regular fa-circle-question\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\n            </span>Question 2\n          </a>\n      </li><li>\n          <a href=\"#a2\">\n              <span class=\"icon is-small ml-0\">\n                <i class=\"fa-solid fa-circle-info\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\n            </span>Answer 2\n          </a>\n      </li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"q2\" class=\"tab-content\">\n          <p>  Where can I get information on the Doctoral Consortium event?
