It reflects not only panelists’ wisdom and my personal bias. It is generally applicable, but may not be always true.</p>\n\n        </div>\n    </article>\n\n<p>I would like to extend my gratitude to the four panelists who generously shared their insights into the academic job search process. Our panelists, Dr. <a href=\"https://home.csulb.edu/~bbehzad/home.html\">Banafsheh Behzad</a>, Dr. <a href=\"https://directory.smeal.psu.edu/jpa5602\">Johanna Amaya</a>, Dr. <a href=\"https://www.umass.edu/engineering/about/directory/muge-capan\">Muge Capan</a>, and Dr. <a href=\"https://engineering.buffalo.edu/industrial-systems/people/faculty-directory.host.html/content/shared/engineering/industrial-systems/profiles/faculty/dell-robert.html\">Robert Dell</a>, brought diverse experiences to the discussion. I’d also like to acknowledge the efforts of our session chairs, Dr. <a href=\"https://faculty.txst.edu/profile/1922475\">Clara M. Novoa Ramirez</a> and Dr. <a href=\"https://engineering.buffalo.edu/industrial-systems/people/faculty-directory.host.html/content/shared/engineering/industrial-systems/profiles/faculty/ramirez-rios-diana.html\">Diana Ramirez-Rios</a>, for organizing this informative session.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Question-1-What-Is-Your-Experience-in-the-Academic-Job-Search-Process\"><a href=\"#Question-1-What-Is-Your-Experience-in-the-Academic-Job-Search-Process\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Question 1 : What Is Your Experience in the Academic Job Search Process?\"></a>Question 1 : What Is Your Experience in the Academic Job Search Process?</h1><p>Our panelists bring a wealth of diverse experiences to the table in the academic job search process. Each of them has held distinct roles in this journey, contributing to a well-rounded perspective:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Leadership Roles</strong> : Some of our panelists have served as deans or provosts of graduate schools, offering insights into the administrative aspects of academic recruitment.</li>\n<li><strong>Search Committee Expertise</strong> : Others have been actively involved in search committees, making critical decisions about candidate selection and hiring.</li>\n<li><strong>Transition between Research and Teaching</strong> : A few of our panelists began their careers as scientists before transitioning into academia as teaching faculty members, ultimately embarking on the tenure track as assistant professors with a strong focus on research.</li>\n<li><strong>Balancing Teaching and Research</strong> : Additionally, our panelists have experience in both teaching and research positions, giving them a comprehensive view of the expectations and challenges in these roles.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This collective expertise ensures that the advice shared during this forum covers a broad spectrum of experiences and positions, making it applicable to a wide range of individuals aspiring to secure their dream academic job.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Question-2-What-Is-the-First-Document-You-Look-at-When-Reviewing-an-Applicant’s-Package\"><a href=\"#Question-2-What-Is-the-First-Document-You-Look-at-When-Reviewing-an-Applicant’s-Package\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Question 2: What Is the First Document You Look at When Reviewing an Applicant’s Package?\"></a>Question 2: What Is the First Document You Look at When Reviewing an Applicant’s Package?</h1><p>Our panelists shared insights on what catches their attention first when reviewing academic job applications. It’s worth noting that different panelists had varying approaches, but the consensus was clear.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The CV&#x2F;Resume</strong> : Many panelists begin by examining the applicant’s CV or resume. This is often the starting point because it provides a snapshot of your academic journey. What are they looking for in your CV?</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Research Topics and Collaborations</strong> : They pay close attention to the research topics you’ve committed to and the co-authors you’ve worked with. This gives them insight into your research interests, your fit with the position’s requirements, and your professional connections.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>The Sequence Matters</strong> : If your CV passes the initial test, the review process usually continues with the cover letter, research statement, and teaching statement. Your CV is like the first impression, and the other documents provide a more in-depth understanding of your qualifications.</li>\n<li><strong>Personalization is Key</strong> : Our panelists stressed the importance of personalization throughout your application. They want to know why you’re interested in their school, what specific topics you plan to work on if hired, and who you see yourself collaborating with on those identified topics.</li>\n<li><strong>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Statement</strong>: If the job posting requires a DEI statement, our panelists emphasized the significance of this document. It’s not just about making a general statement on diversity and inclusion, but rather contextualizing your beliefs.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Defining DEI</strong> : Explain how you define diversity, equity, and inclusion.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal Connection</strong> : Share how DEI matters to you and how it shapes your approach.</li>\n<li><strong>Integration in Teaching and Research</strong> : Illustrate how DEI principles are woven into your teaching and research.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The panelists were clear that a “desk reject” (rejection without further consideration) could happen if the DEI statement is required but not submitted. So, don’t overlook this aspect if it’s part of the application requirements.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Question-3-What-Is-the-Most-Challenging-Part-of-the-Job-Search-Process\"><a href=\"#Question-3-What-Is-the-Most-Challenging-Part-of-the-Job-Search-Process\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Question 3: What Is the Most Challenging Part of the Job Search Process?\"></a>Question 3: What Is the Most Challenging Part of the Job Search Process?</h1><ol>\n<li><strong>Keeping Track of Applications:</strong> Several panelists emphasized the difficulty of staying organized throughout the application process. As the number of applications increases, it can become increasingly challenging to manage all the necessary documents, deadlines, and personalization requirements for each school. This includes tailoring your application materials to match the specific needs and preferences of each institution.</li>\n<li><strong>Choosing the Right Type of School:</strong> Another point of discussion revolved around the decision to apply for positions in business schools versus engineering schools. Panelists had differing opinions on this matter. While some believed that there should be no restrictions on the types of schools you consider, it’s crucial to be aware of the differences between these two school types. These distinctions encompass cultural aspects, expectations, deliverables, and tenure criteria. So, when deciding where to apply, it’s vital to consider how well your background and aspirations align with the unique characteristics of the department or school.</li>\n<li><strong>Strategic Application:</strong> Panelists also emphasized the importance of applying strategically. They advised prospective job seekers to have a clear understanding of their goals, reasons for wanting to join a particular school, and how well they fit within the department’s culture. In other words, it’s not just about the quantity of applications, but also about the quality and alignment of your applications with your career aspirations.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"Question-4-What-Are-the-Dos-and-Don’ts-in-the-Job-Search-Process\"><a href=\"#Question-4-What-Are-the-Dos-and-Don’ts-in-the-Job-Search-Process\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Question 4: What Are the Dos and Don’ts in the Job Search Process?\"></a>Question 4: What Are the Dos and Don’ts in the Job Search Process?</h1><p><strong>Dos</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Craft an Engaging Elevator Speech:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Your elevator speech should succinctly highlight your research interests, achievements, and future plans. Make it captivating and relevant to your field. This is often your first impression, so it’s crucial to grab the committee’s attention.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Know the Search Committee Members:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Do your homework and familiarize yourself with the members of the search committee. Understand their areas of interest and expertise. This will enable you to tailor your conversation to topics of mutual interest and demonstrate how your skills complement the program’s needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Don’ts</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Don’t Apply Blindly:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid applying to institutions that you are absolutely certain you wouldn’t want to join. Your application should be a reflection of your genuine interest in the position and the institution, not a scattergun approach.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Don’t Obsess Over Tenure Criteria:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>While tenure is important, don’t let it overwhelm your job search process. Focus on showcasing your qualifications and fit for the position. Tenure discussions can happen later in the process.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Don’t Overdo It in Interviews:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s important to be yourself during interviews. Trying too hard to impress can come across as insincere. Let your authentic self shine through, allowing the search committee to make an informed judgment.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Don’t Exceed Time Limits:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Stick to the allotted time when answering interview questions. Finishing on time shows respect for the committee’s schedule and allows them to ask more questions and learn more about you.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Avoid Lengthy Publication Lists:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>When presenting your research profile, avoid overwhelming the committee with a long list of publications. Instead, provide a concise summary of your key takeaways, emphasizing the knowledge, accomplishments, and contributions that are most relevant to the position and the institution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"Question-5-Should-Applicants-from-Minority-Represented-Groups-Conceal-Their-Background\"><a href=\"#Question-5-Should-Applicants-from-Minority-Represented-Groups-Conceal-Their-Background\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Question 5: Should Applicants from Minority-Represented Groups Conceal Their Background?\"></a>Question 5: Should Applicants from Minority-Represented Groups Conceal Their Background?</h1><p>All panelists unanimously agree that applicants should approach their minority-represented status with transparency and confidence. It is essential to never hide or downplay one’s belonging to a minority group, whether it’s related to culture, background, or ability. These unique characteristics can offer valuable perspectives and contribute to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts within academia.</p>\n<p>Applicants are encouraged to take pride in what makes them unique and to share how these distinctive aspects are reflected in their research and teaching. There’s no need to feel shy or ashamed about your background or identity. Embracing your true self is key. Instead of trying to conform to a perceived norm, let the match between you and the institution occur naturally.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Question-6-What-Sets-Apart-Virtual-Interviews-from-In-Person-Interviews\"><a href=\"#Question-6-What-Sets-Apart-Virtual-Interviews-from-In-Person-Interviews\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Question 6: What Sets Apart Virtual Interviews from In-Person Interviews?\"></a>Question 6: What Sets Apart Virtual Interviews from In-Person Interviews?</h1><p><strong>Virtual Interviews as a Marathon:</strong> Some of our panelists described virtual interviews, particularly the campus visit ones, as marathon events. This is because in a virtual setting, you don’t have the luxury of time between one-on-one conversations, unlike in-person interviews where you can physically move from one office to another. This tight schedule can make virtual interviews more challenging in terms of time management.</p>\n<p><strong>The Value of In-Person Connection:</strong> On the other hand, some panelists expressed a preference for in-person interviews due to the physical contact and face-to-face experience they offer. Building a personal connection and rapport with interviewers and the campus community can be easier in an in-person setting.</p>\n<p><strong>Controlling Noise Levels:</strong> Regardless of whether it’s a virtual or in-person interview, our panelists emphasized the importance of controlling noise levels during the interview. Background noise or disruptions can detract from your presentation and the panel’s ability to focus, so it’s crucial to find a quiet and distraction-free environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Adapting to Lecture Modalities:</strong> Another important point raised by our panelists was the need for candidates to be aware of the various lecture modalities, such as offline, online, and hybrid teaching, and the evolving student population. As academic job seekers, you should be prepared to adjust your teaching methods to accommodate different lecture formats and cater to diverse student learning styles.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Audience-Question-1-How-to-Deliver-the-First-Impression-Effectively-in-the-Interview\"><a href=\"#Audience-Question-1-How-to-Deliver-the-First-Impression-Effectively-in-the-Interview\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Audience Question 1: How to Deliver the First Impression Effectively in the Interview?\"></a>Audience Question 1: How to Deliver the First Impression Effectively in the Interview?</h1><p>Panelists emphasized the importance of crafting a powerful first impression during academic job interviews. Think of this impression as a concise collection of keywords that represent you effectively. Here’s a breakdown:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Keywords</strong> : Your first impression should encapsulate key information, such as your name, university, major, and research interests. These are the fundamental elements that will help interviewers remember you.</li>\n<li><strong>Conciseness</strong> : Keep it short and to the point. Long-winded introductions can dilute your message. Aim for clarity and brevity.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"Audience-Question-2-What-Is-the-Role-of-Networking\"><a href=\"#Audience-Question-2-What-Is-the-Role-of-Networking\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Audience Question 2: What Is the Role of Networking?\"></a>Audience Question 2: What Is the Role of Networking?</h1><p>Networking is a crucial element in your academic job search. It can significantly boost your chances of success by increasing your visibility and building connections within the academic community. Here are some key strategies to make the most of networking:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Attend Networking Events:</strong> Actively participate in networking events, such as conference receptions, workshops, and seminars related to your field. These gatherings provide excellent opportunities to meet potential colleagues and employers.</li>\n<li><strong>Initiate Conversations:</strong> Don’t be passive during these events. Be proactive and engage in meaningful conversations with fellow attendees. Be open to discussing your research, interests, and goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Leverage Conference Programs:</strong> Take advantage of conference programs and directories to identify people you want to connect with. Prioritize those who share your research interests or work in institutions you’re interested in.

Getting a faculty position approved can be a daunting task for universities. Therefore, even when a job advertisement appears quite vague or general, you should still consider applying. Here’s why:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Broad Advertisements:</strong> When a job ad is general in nature, it often indicates that the search committee is open to a wide range of candidates. This means you have a chance to throw your hat into the ring and showcase your unique skills, both in research and teaching.</li>\n<li><strong>Tailoring for Targeted Ads:</strong> On the other hand, when a job ad is highly specific, it’s crucial to align your application materials and interview responses with the stated requirements. Dr. Capan advises that you should meticulously tailor your documents and interview pitches to match the job description. This shows that you’ve done your homework and are genuinely interested in the role.</li>\n<li><strong>Demonstrate Added Value:</strong> Regardless of the ad’s specificity, you can also set yourself apart by illustrating what you can bring to the school. Highlight your unique qualities, ideas, or projects that could benefit the institution. Show them how you can be an asset, even if you don’t perfectly match every requirement.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"My-Original-Notes\"><a href=\"#My-Original-Notes\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"My Original Notes\"></a>My Original Notes</h1><div id=\"NotesPics-MA60\" class=\"justified-gallery\" align=\"center\">\n\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.yihong-liu.com/2023/10/21/Crack-the-Academic-Job-Hunt-Code-Insider-Tips/MA60-Notes-1.jpg\" alt=\"Page 1\"><br><img src=\"https://blog.yihong-liu.com/2023/10/21/Crack-the-Academic-Job-Hunt-Code-Insider-Tips/MA60-Notes-2.jpg\" alt=\"Page 2\"><br><img src=\"https://blog.yihong-liu.com/2023/10/21/Crack-the-Academic-Job-Hunt-Code-Insider-Tips/MA60-Notes-3.jpg\" alt=\"Page 3\"><br><img src=\"https://blog.yihong-liu.com/2023/10/21/Crack-the-Academic-Job-Hunt-Code-Insider-Tips/MA60-Notes-4.jpg\" alt=\"Page 4\"><br><img src=\"https://blog.yihong-liu.com/2023/10/21/Crack-the-Academic-Job-Hunt-Code-Insider-Tips/MA60-Notes-5.jpg\" alt=\"Page 5\"><br><img src=\"https://blog.yihong-liu.com/2023/10/21/Crack-the-Academic-Job-Hunt-Code-Insider-Tips/MA60-Notes-6.jpg\" alt=\"Page 6\"><br><img src=\"https://blog.yihong-liu.com/2023/10/21/Crack-the-Academic-Job-Hunt-Code-Insider-Tips/MA60-Notes-7.jpg\" alt=\"Page 7\"><br><img src=\"https://blog.yihong-liu.com/2023/10/21/Crack-the-Academic-Job-Hunt-Code-Insider-Tips/MA60-Notes-8.jpg\" alt=\"Page 8\"></p>\n</div>\n\n<p><a style=\"background-color:black;color:white;text-decoration:none;padding:4px 6px;font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Ubuntu, Roboto, Noto, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;font-weight:bold;line-height:1.2;display:inline-block;border-radius:3px\" href=\"https://unsplash.com/@markuswinkler?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Download free do whatever you want high-resolution photos from Markus Winkler\"><span style=\"display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"height:12px;width:auto;position:relative;vertical-align:middle;top:-2px;fill:white\" viewBox=\"0 0 32 32\"><title>unsplash-logo</title><path d=\"M10 9V0h12v9H10zm12 5h10v18H0V14h10v9h12v-9z\"></path></svg></span><span style=\"display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px\">thumbnail by Markus Winkler</span></a></p>\n",

The path can be challenging, but learning from the experiences of those who have successfully navigated it can be immensely helpful.</p>\n<span id=\"more\"></span>\n<p>Here is a brief summary of insights and advice shared by three scholars, Dr. <a href=\"https://leilahosseini.wixsite.com/leila\">Leila Hosseini</a>, Dr. <a href=\"https://sameermehta.me/\">Sameer Mehta</a>, Dr. <a href=\"https://muratmtunc.github.io/\">Murat Tunc</a> during a panel discussion at the JSOM IS Seminar in 2020. </p>\n<p>I really appreciate the generous and comprehensive sharing about their job seeking experiences.<br>I also want to thank Dr. <a href=\"https://jindal.utdallas.edu/faculty/varghese-jacob\">Varghese S. Jacob</a> to host this panel.<br>These seasoned professionals offer invaluable guidance to aspiring tenure-track job seekers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Before-the-Interviews-Preparing-for-the-Position\"><a href=\"#Before-the-Interviews-Preparing-for-the-Position\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Before the Interviews: Preparing for the Position\"></a>Before the Interviews: Preparing for the Position</h2><p>The journey begins between July and October when academic institutions typically start posting tenure-track positions. The exact timing may vary depending on your field, so stay vigilant. It’s essential to have your application materials ready before the hiring season kicks off. These materials typically include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Curriculum Vitae</strong> (CV): A well-organized document highlighting your academic journey and achievements.</li>\n<li><strong>Teaching and Research Statements</strong>: Clear and concise statements outlining your teaching philosophy and research interests.</li>\n<li><strong>Teaching Evaluations</strong>: Evidence of your teaching effectiveness, if available.</li>\n<li><strong>Recommendation Letters</strong>: Strong letters of recommendation from reputable sources.</li>\n<li><strong>Paper Copies</strong>: Copies of your publications or research papers (requirements may vary by institution).</li>\n<li><strong>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Statement</strong>: Outlines of your commitment to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember, only include projects and papers that you’re well-versed in. Additionally, be prepared to succinctly discuss the content of your CV within two minutes. Collaborating with your PhD colleagues can also be beneficial in this preparation phase.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Interview-I-The-Initial-Encounter\"><a href=\"#Interview-I-The-Initial-Encounter\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Interview I: The Initial Encounter\"></a>Interview I: The Initial Encounter</h2><p>The first-round interview, whether conducted online or in person at a conference, usually lasts around 30 minutes. This interview typically follows a structured format:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Introduce Yourself</strong>: Begin by succinctly presenting your research focus and its relevance.</li>\n<li><strong>Research Landscape</strong>: Discuss your research topics and methodologies.</li>\n<li><strong>Research Details</strong>: Articulate why your research is significant and provide specific insights into your work.</li>\n<li><strong>Additional Research Questions</strong>: Be prepared for philosophical inquiries about the Information Systems (IS) field. Share your future research plans, including topics, domains, and methodologies. Familiarize yourself with the faculty members you’d like to work with (at least two).</li>\n<li><strong>Teaching Questions</strong>: Expect questions about your teaching experience, teaching philosophy, and your plans for specific courses.</li>\n<li><strong>Ask Your Questions</strong>: Use this opportunity to inquire about the timeline for decisions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When managing your time during this interview, allocate approximately 90% to research-related topics, 5% to teaching, and 5% to your questions for the interviewers. Use your limited time to convey the key points of your research convincingly and demonstrate why you’re the right fit for the position.</p>\n<p>Remember to establish connections between your teaching and research. Articulate clear motivations for your choice of teaching domain rather than merely discussing a topic. Avoid making unsupported statements; always provide reasons and justifications.</p>\n<p>If you’re attending a conference, it’s not only an opportunity to network and make connections but also to prepare your application package. You might find universities actively hiring at these events, so having your materials on hand is crucial.</p>\n<p>For international institutions, be ready to explain your motivation for seeking a position there clearly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Interview-II-The-Campus-Visit\"><a href=\"#Interview-II-The-Campus-Visit\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Interview II: The Campus Visit\"></a>Interview II: The Campus Visit</h2><p>Typically, you’ll receive campus visit invitations after the first-round interviews. Some schools may offer direct invitations without the initial interview, although this is less common. During your campus visit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dress professionally, adhering to a business suit dress code, especially in a business school setting.</li>\n<li>Remember, they’re not just looking for a researcher; they want an engaging colleague. Don’t immediately dive into your research; make it exciting and memorable. Incorporate anecdotes, jokes, or stories relevant to your presentation to captivate your audience.</li>\n<li>Prepare for questions about how your research theory relates to practice and vice versa. Practice answering questions, manage your presentation time effectively, and remember that practice makes perfect.</li>\n<li>Customize your questions for each institution to demonstrate that you’ve done your research. Familiarize yourself with the faculty’s work and connect your research to their contributions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"After-the-Interviews-Making-the-Right-Choice\"><a href=\"#After-the-Interviews-Making-the-Right-Choice\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"After the Interviews: Making the Right Choice\"></a>After the Interviews: Making the Right Choice</h2><p>After all the interviews, when you’re faced with multiple offers, consider the following factors to make an informed decision:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Know Your Goals</strong>: Define what you want from your career. Is it the best business school, a strong IS department, productive faculty, or opportunities for collaboration outside IS?</li>\n<li><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong>: Consider the financial aspects of the offers, including salary, benefits, and any additional perks.</li>\n<li><strong>Culture, Geography, and Personal Factors</strong>: Reflect on the institution’s culture, location, and any opportunities it may offer for your spouse or family.</li>\n<li><strong>Teaching and Service Load</strong>: Assess the teaching and service expectations, as well as any requirements for assistant or tenure-track professors.</li>\n<li><strong>Tenure Criteria</strong>: Understand the specific criteria and expectations for earning tenure at each institution. This includes research productivity, teaching performance, and any service obligations. Ensure they align with your career goals and capabilities.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Summary\"><a href=\"#Summary\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Summary\"></a>Summary</h2><p>In conclusion, maximizing your research potential and ensuring your happiness are keys to success in securing a tenure-track position. It’s a competitive journey, but with careful preparation, thoughtful presentation, and consideration of your personal and professional goals, you can increase your chances of landing your dream job in academia. Good luck!</p>\n<p><a style=\"background-color:black;color:white;text-decoration:none;padding:4px 6px;font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Ubuntu, Roboto, Noto, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;font-weight:bold;line-height:1.2;display:inline-block;border-radius:3px\" href=\"https://unsplash.com/@mkvandergriff?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Download free do whatever you want high-resolution photos from Maranda Vandergriff\"><span style=\"display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"height:12px;width:auto;position:relative;vertical-align:middle;top:-2px;fill:white\" viewBox=\"0 0 32 32\"><title>unsplash-logo</title><path d=\"M10 9V0h12v9H10zm12 5h10v18H0V14h10v9h12v-9z\"></path></svg></span><span style=\"display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px\">thumbnail by Maranda Vandergriff</span></a></p>\n",
